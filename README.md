# Project-Euler-In-Java    
This repository is a java implement for solving the matthew.problem in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).   

## matthew.Tools.java    
I put some commonly used function in this file:    
`public static boolean isPrime(Long number)` : Whether this number is prime or not    

## matthew.Main.java
Call the function `matthew.Problem.solve()`, then print this result as well as the time expended.

## matthew.Problem.java
The interface of the solution. When you solve a matthew.problem, you should implement this interface.
